My name is Fan Wang (Katherine), who is a cute girl and likes kittens very much, meow~. 

As we know, deep-learning-based AI technologies have shown remarkable success in a variety of fields, including data mining, computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. In recent years, AI Generated Content (AIGC) quickly attracted a lot of attention from academia and industry. It seems AI is evolving from "Analytical AI" to "Generative AI", corresponding to the statement "humans are not only good at analyzing things—we are also good at creating."

In this regard, I often wonder if AI can perform more advanced generations, e.g., artistic creation. So what will art look like in the eyes of AI? Are their arts the same or different from ours?
To satisfy my curiosity, my research interest aims to empower the artistic creation of AI with a variety of Deep Generative Models, e,g., VAE, GANs, and Diffusion Models.

On this website, I will share some awesome AI-generated artwork. If you have any questions or interests, welcome to discuss them with me by [astrowong@outlook.com](astrowong@outlook.com).
